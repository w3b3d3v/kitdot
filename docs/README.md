## 📚 Documentation Philosophy

This documentation follows a layered approach:

- **Root level**: Entry points and high-level overviews
- **Architecture**: Comprehensive technical documentation
- **Product**: Business and feature specifications
- **Analysis**: Technical decisions and rationale
- **Guidelines**: Standards and processes

Each document is designed to be standalone while linking to related concepts, enabling both linear reading and reference lookup.
