# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**CLI Security:**
- Input Validation: All user inputs validated against injection attacks
- File System Access: Restricted to user-specified directories only
- Network Requests: Limited to trusted domains (GitHub, rustup.rs)

**Template Security:**
- Template Validation: All templates validated before execution
- Remote Fetching: Only from approved repositories
- Dependency Installation: User consent required for all installations

## Performance Optimization

**CLI Performance:**
- Startup Time Target: < 2 seconds for command initialization
- Template Caching: Local cache for faster subsequent operations
- Parallel Operations: Concurrent template fetching and validation

**Resource Management:**
- Memory Usage: Efficient streaming for large template downloads
- Network Usage: Resume capabilities for interrupted downloads
- Disk Usage: Automatic cleanup of temporary files
