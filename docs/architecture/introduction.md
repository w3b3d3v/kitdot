# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **kitdot**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template Analysis

**Current State:** kitdot uses official Parity templates (react-solidity-hardhat) and remote GitHub template loading. The project already has:
- Established CLI architecture with TypeScript
- Template validation system
- Integration with existing Polkadot Cloud tooling
- Official Parity template integration

**Architecture Constraints:**
- Must maintain CLI-first approach as primary interface
- Templates loaded remotely from GitHub repositories
- TypeScript throughout the stack for consistency
- Integration with existing Polkadot Cloud tooling
