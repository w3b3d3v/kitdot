# **Brand Guidelines**

## 1. **Core Brand Values**

- **Open Collaboration:** Visuals must communicate a sense of community, cooperation, and creativity.
- **Future-Forward:** Designs should feel ahead of their time — technological, bold, and slightly surreal.
- **Human-Centric:** Characters and scenes remain approachable, diverse, and expressive.
- **Playful but Sharp:** Blend optimism with precision. Shapes should be clean but not overly corporate.

## 2. **Color Palette**

Use your existing colors as the backbone of the visual identity.

**Primary Colors**

- **Ultra Pink:** `#FE5AFE` – Hero color, used for calls-to-action, highlights, main accents.
- **Tekhelet / Tekhelet 2:** `#401C95` / `#501DA2` – Core brand background colors, create depth and gradients.
- **Purple:** `#800080` – Secondary accents, subtle gradients.
- **Black:** `#000000` – Typography, outlines, high contrast backgrounds.

**Rules**

- Favor **gradients** blending Tekhelet → Tekhelet-2 → Ultra Pink for major backgrounds.
- Keep **high contrast** between background and content.
- Use **Ultra Pink** sparingly for emphasis (max 20% of a frame).

## 3. **Typography**

- **Primary Font:** Clean geometric sans-serif (e.g., Space Grotesk, Inter, or Futura-like).
- **Secondary Font:** Monospace or display font for headings/UI (techno feel).
- **Rules:**

  - Always maintain legibility against deep purple/black backgrounds.
  - Apply subtle **glow/shadow effects** on headings to evoke neon signage.
  - Use **bold weights** for emphasis, thin weights for UI labels.

## 4. **Illustration Style**

Inspired by Ethereum's illustration system but adapted:

- **Characters:** Hand-drawn, diverse, inclusive.

  - **Clothing:** Futuristic streetwear, cyberpunk accessories.
  - **Pose Language:** Active, collaborative, exchanging ideas, using devices.

- **Linework:** Clean, medium thickness outlines; consider adding glowing edges.
- **Lighting:** Use rim light or neon glow to match brand colors.
- **Scenes:** Rooftops, digital plazas, neon-lit lounges, floating UI panels.
- **Perspective:** Mix isometric and dynamic angles for depth and energy.

## 5. **Logo & Iconography**

- **Logo Usage:**

  - Display logo on Tekhelet or black backgrounds for maximum contrast.
  - Allow glow in Ultra Pink for digital contexts (social media, web).

- **Icon Style:** Minimal, line-based, geometric. Use Ultra Pink glow on hover or active states.

---

## 6. **Motion & Interactivity**

- **Animation Style:** Smooth, subtle glows, hover states with neon flicker.
- **Microinteractions:** Button presses light up in Ultra Pink, transitions slide smoothly.
- **Scene Animations:** Consider slow parallax effects, floating elements, soft gradients shifting over time.

---

## 7. **Do / Don’t**

**Do:**

- Combine dark backgrounds with vibrant pink/purple highlights.
- Keep characters friendly and inclusive.
- Use gradients, glow, and motion to evoke energy.

**Don’t:**

- Overuse Ultra Pink (avoid eye strain).
- Use purely flat design with no light effects (kills the futuristic vibe).
- Make illustrations too corporate or sterile.
